K-Pop Industry Database Simulation

This project is a SQL Server database designed to simulate the K-pop entertainment ecosystem. It includes multiple interconnected tables representing core entities in the industry:

Groups – K-pop groups with attributes like debut date, genre, and company affiliation.

Idols – Individual performers linked to groups, with details like age, position, and nationality.

Companies – Entertainment agencies managing multiple groups and idols.

Albums & Songs – Music releases from groups, including song metadata.

Awards – Records of accolades received by groups and idols.

Fandoms – Fan communities associated with groups and idols.

The database is populated with realistic sample data featuring popular K-pop acts like BTS, BLACKPINK, Seventeen, and TWICE. Relationships between tables reflect real-world connections: idols belong to groups, groups are managed by companies, albums contain multiple songs, and awards and fandoms are linked to relevant artists.

This project is ideal for learning about relational databases, practicing SQL queries, and exploring data modeling for entertainment industries. It demonstrates proper use of foreign keys, constraints, and data integrity while keeping the structure clear and easy to understand.
